# 🏡 AI-Powered Real Estate Inquiry Bot

Hi! I'm Shena, a part-time property specialist who's also learning how to code. While exploring Python and automation tools, I thought it would be fun to build a simple bot that helps answer common real estate questions.

This is a beginner-friendly project where I used Python to simulate how an AI chatbot might help someone looking to buy property — like condos or house-and-lot units — in the Philippines.

Right now, it runs in the terminal, but I’m excited to keep learning and eventually bring this to a real app or website.

## ✨ What It Can Do

✅ Greet users  
✅ Ask what type of property they’re looking for  
✅ Offer basic replies based on user input  
✅ Give next-step suggestions like scheduling a viewing or connecting with an agent

## 🛠 Tools I Used

- Python (beginner level)
- Google Colab
- Basic terminal input/output
- Markdown for this README 😉

## 💡 Why I Built This

I’m exploring tech and coding while working part-time in real estate, so I wanted to build something simple but related to my day-to-day work. This bot is just a small step, but it helped me understand how AI could make real estate inquiries smoother and faster.

I'm hoping to keep learning, automate more tasks, and eventually build smarter tools with APIs or web integrations!

## 📌 What’s Next

- Add more detailed responses  
- Make it web-based (maybe using Flask)  
- Explore connecting it with real property listings  
- Use real AI models via API when I’m ready

Thanks for checking out my mini project! 😊
